# incus-apply

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a fork of [abiosoft/incus-apply](https://github.com/abiosoft/incus-apply).
>
> The fork tracks upstream while adding a narrow embeddable API and native Go integration points needed by downstream consumers such as Aginctus. Changes should stay small, well-tested, and suitable for upstreaming whenever possible. For the canonical upstream project, releases, and documentation, see [abiosoft/incus-apply](https://github.com/abiosoft/incus-apply).
